Space complexity: look at the creation of new objects (such as arrays)

Amortized time: consider all aspects of the algorithm and not just the worst case operation time, but also the less costly operations across the entire algorithm.Thus, we have the worst-case run time for the algorithm

Run time with recursive functions: usually O(branches ^ depth)
